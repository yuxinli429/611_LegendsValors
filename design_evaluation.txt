1. For the three new actions for hero in Legends2:teleport, back and attack, we create three corresponding
methods in the Hero class. The LegendsOfValor class controls the main process of the entire Game. Compared
with creating those three methods in the LegendsOfValor, we make them as methods of the Hero class, so we
can reuse them in other Legends-like games. Plus, instead of letting the LegendsOfValor handle all the user
input in this game, we move part of them into those three methods in the Hero, so it will decrease the
complexity of the LegendsOfValor. In addition, at first, we changed the position of a hero inside the tele-
port and back methods but soon found that these two behaviors may vary depend on different types of cells.
If we simply pass the configuration of this game into these two methods as arguments, then the implementation
of them depends on the rule of this game, which may deteriorate the scalability of our code. As a result, we
set the position of hero only in the LegendsOfValor class.
